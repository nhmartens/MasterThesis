# Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Cryptocurrencies on Binance
Repository to the Master Thesis of Nils Martens

This repository contains the code of the modelling for the master thesis of Nils Martens as part of the Master in Banking and Finance at the University of St. Gallen, and the Master in Business Analytics & Management at Rotterdam School of Management. The dataset (in total ca. 7 GB) exceeds the size restrictions set by Github, hence the dataset cannot be included in this repository. The data was obtained through a subscription to Kaiko by the University of St.Gallen and cannot be shared publicly. Model training was conducted on an Apple M1 Max GPU with unified memory of 64 GB. For reference, the training of the model for five different prediction horizonsn takes about six to eight hours. 

The two scripts included in the repository are:

01  Data Preparation

02  Model Training and Analysis
